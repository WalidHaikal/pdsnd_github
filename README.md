### Date created
21 Sep 2021
### Project Title
Udacity-Project-Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

### Description
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
bikeshare.py       - final project
chicago.zip        - dataset used for analysis (zipped csv file)
new_york_city.zip  - dataset used for analysis (zipped csv file)
washington.zip     - dataset used for analysis (zipped csv file)
bikeshare.py       - final project

### Running the program:
You can input 'python bikeshare.py' on your terminal to run this program. I use Anaconda's command prompt on a Windows 10 machine.
