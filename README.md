### Date created:
22 Sep 2021

### Project Title:
Udacity-Project-Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

### Description:
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Benifet of bikeshare project in the real world:
The objective of the BikeSahre project is to assist and support the customer to get the needed information about the Bikes Sharing in 3 cities in USA; Chicago, New York City, and Washington through statistical and analytical methods Based on the customer input the required data will be shared with him/her.

### Files used:
This repository contains: Three csv files, And one python file written to assess the data.

bikeshare.py       - final project
chicago.zip        - dataset used for analysis (zipped csv file)
new_york_city.zip  - dataset used for analysis (zipped csv file)
washington.zip     - dataset used for analysis (zipped csv file)

### Running the program:
You can input 'python bikeshare.py' on your terminal to run this program. I use Anaconda's command prompt on a Windows 10 machine.

### Built with:
